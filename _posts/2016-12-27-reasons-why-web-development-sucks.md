Ow where should I get started. Web development as we can see right now is a damn mess. Its hairy, its ugly and its getting worse. Here's a list of the things that make it this way. 

### 1. Way too many Frameworks!

Just google "What should a modern web developer learn?". You will see 12-30 minutes video showcasing a freaking learning tree about the Frameworks and libraries that you should have an idea about. Ain't nobody got time for that. Everyone is like "Hey why should I need to learn vanilla JS when I could start with just JQuery or some other hipster named framework or library.". When you ask a question on Stack Overflow on how to do something with JS the typical answer is "Just add the library 'x' and write this one line". I say "Boy I don't wanna add a 800kB of code just for doing something that I am sure can be done with 10-20 lines.". The web community has this nasty habit of spurting out frameworks by the minute. Hell, by the time I am finished writing this another crap framework might be released in some part of the web.

### 2. The myth of a Full Stack Web Developer.

Gone are the days when you could just jack off knowing that only learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP would get you a job. Companies want everything done in less time with less people and less hassle to deal with. They don't have the time to train you, time is money! You either know it or you don't. Also what's the deal with the "Full Stack Developer". That mythical creature who knows everything from the front end to the back end. Is that even possible? You absoulutely can't know **EVERYTHING.**

### 3. There is no standard among platforms!

Pretty sure when you started programming for the web no one told you that browser vendors absolutely hate each other. Its not been long since they came up with some standards regarding how the pages should behave but we still get bits of weird behavior here and there(** Internet Explorer, ahem **). The thing is I don't blame them, they are after all a business and they all want things that benefit their cause. The trend is set way faster than they can react over. The problem is that clients who hire us won't understand that.

I know no one said it would be easy but this is a freaking mess. Life was so much better when blinking texts were trendy. Got any other sad things that pisses you off about being a web dev? Or is there anything you wanna counter argue? Comment below then.
