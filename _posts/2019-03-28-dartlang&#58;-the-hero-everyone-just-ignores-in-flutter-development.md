Flutter is hailed for how easy it makes building cross platform apps but little do people mention the secret sauce behind it, which has to be [dartlang](https://www.dartlang.org/). TBH, JavaScript usage for building applications is a behemoth compared to that of people using Dart for their day to day lives. The only reason I learnt Dart is because learning flutter forced me to but when I did then I was amazed how well it binds all the good things of functional and object oriented programming together.

### Builds on top of what Java missed
The main issues people face with Java is embedded in the Java SDK, i.e, the decisions were taken a long time ago and now things can't be changed. Dart on the other hand was built from scratch recently and everything was built bottom up keeping the needs of modern developers in mind. Also, Dartlang team consists of really smart engineers who specialize in compilers, so a lot of smart optimizations happen in the compiler level which brings me to my next point. 

### Can switch between AOT and JIT
Flutter can switch between ahead of time compilation and just in time compilation. Especially, if you are a Java dev then you will find it as God send.
