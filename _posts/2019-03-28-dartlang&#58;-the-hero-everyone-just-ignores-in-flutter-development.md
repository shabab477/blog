Flutter is hailed for how easy it makes building cross platform apps but little do people mention the secret sauce behind it, which has to be [dartlang](https://www.dartlang.org/). TBH, JavaScript usage for building applications is a behemoth compared to that of people using Dart for their day to day lives. The only reason I learnt Dart is because learning flutter forced me to but when I did then I was amazed how well it binds all the good things of functional and object oriented programming together.
