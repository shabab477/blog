## About
This blog is not made for you. It is most definitely not meant to help you. SHEEESH!! Did you really think I am gonna go through the trouble of learning new things every week and write content about it to help you compensate for your lack of motivation? **<u>NO!!!</u>**

Now that I have cleared things up it is time to explain why in God's name am I writing this blog. Well, I have told you before that in order to keep on writing this blog I need to learn new things every week. I believe this is what's going to benefit me. Being a lazy person I need a re-inforcement to get things done. The light at the end of the tunnel which I must keep running towards to keep myself alive, if you must say. Along the process if it really benefits you then hurray for me but trust me when I say that it's not meant to help you. 

Anyways, all this learning can be really boring. It **<u>WILL</u>** be boring. So to mix things up a lot of memes will show up. Yes you read it right. **MEMES!!!**

### Content
What I meant with learning new things is not very specific. It can be about new tech, politics, economics or just life. It is true that I will try to keep things related to tech because let's get real, I have no life.

So to summarize myself, this blog will have two things. They are:

1. Some observance made on tech, politics, economics or life.
2. Dank Memes.

Last but not least: Catch me [here](#) if you want to know what deep dark secrets that I hold behind this mask of red-green-blue mixed pixels. 

Enjoy! Actually, please **DON'T**
